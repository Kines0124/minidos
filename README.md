# minidos

## About
minidos is a small DOS implementation, whose functions are quite similar to those of the original MS-DOS, with the difference of covering not only DOS commands but also Linux commands. The project was made using the C# language on Cosmos (C# Open Source Managed Operating System).

## Resources
In order to use the minidos application, it is necessary to obtain the following resources:
- Cosmos OS SDK.
- A virtual machine to get the operating system running. VMware Player is recommended.
