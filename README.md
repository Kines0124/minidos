## About
`minidos` is a small DOS implementation, whose functions are quite similar to those of the original MS-DOS, with the difference of covering not only DOS commands but also Linux commands. The project was made using the C# language on Cosmos (C# Open Source Managed Operating System).

## Prerequisites
In order to use the minidos application, it is necessary to obtain the following resources:
- [Cosmos OS SDK](https://github.com/CosmosOS/Cosmos)
- A virtual machine to get the operating system running. VMware Player is recommended. You can obtain the setup installation [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/desktop-hypervisor/workstation-and-fusion).

## HowTo
To get the software runnning, you must first install the latest version of Visual Studio and a .NET Core 8.0 or higher. Then, you also will need to acquire a virtual machine (in this example, we will be using VMware Player, but Cosmos also support Virtual Box and VMware Workstation). Lastly, it is necessary to isntall the the Cosmos OS SDK, that is linked in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) subsection.
